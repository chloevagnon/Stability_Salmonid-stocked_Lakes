# Stability_Salmonid-stocked_Lakes
 This repository is the repository for the article: 
 Changes in vertical and horizontal diversities mediated by the size structure of introduced fish collectively shape food-web stability

 This repository is composed of 6 elements: \
    - cv_Functions_Stability_Salmonid_Stocked_Lakes: the functions used in the framework of the Figure 1 \
    - Param_reginvert.Rdata : quantile regressions required to compute niche boundaries of invertebrate consumers (from the aNM; Vagnon et al. 2021) \
    - Param_regvert.Rdata :  quantile regressions required to compute niche boundaries of vertebrate consumers (from the aNM; Vagnon et al. 2021) \
    \
    - cv_Codes_Stability_Salmonid-stocked_Lakes: the code for applying the functions to the simple example of Test_DATA.Rdata \
    - Test_Data: a test dataset to apply quickly the different functions and understand how can be computed stability \
    - BigData: the whole dataset of the 195 nodes included in the metaweb of the article.\
