# Stability_Salmonid-stocked_Lakes
# This repository is the repository for the article: 
# Changes in vertical and horizontal diversities mediated by the size structure of introduced fish collectively shape food-web stability

# This repository is composed of 4 elements: 
#    - cv_Functions_Stability_Salmonid_Stocked_Lakes: the functions used in the framework of the Figure 1
#    - cv_Codes_Stability_Salmonid-stocked_Lakes: the code for applying the functions to a simple example (Test_DATA.Rdata)
#    - Test_Data: a test dataset to apply quickly the different functions and understand how can be computed stability 
#    - BigData: the whole dataset of the 195 nodes included in the metaweb of the article.
